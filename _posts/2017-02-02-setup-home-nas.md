Normally when we want to backup data or transfer that among different devices, we need to do these actions one by one:

+ plug in the external drive to device-1  
+ transfer data from device-1 to the drive  
+ plug out the external drive from device-1  
+ plug in the external drive to device-#  
+ transfer data from the drive to device-#

The above described solution is not bad for common usage, but personally I like __DRY__ and make it in practise, which means I always try to automate the things that can be automated to save life. ðŸ˜Ž

So here is the guide that I would like to share about __how to setup NAS for home with RPi and Docker__.

#### Preparation
+ [setup RPi][1]
+ [setup Docker on RPi][2]
+ [mount external HD on RPi][3]

#### Setup NAS
> I will use [Minio][4] and [Docker][5], here is the [docker image for minio-pi][6] built by myself

+ Create local persistent folder & config files
  - they will be mapped to docker container

  ```
  cd /mnt
  mkdir minio_storage
  cd /mnt/minio_storage
  # new and add the following configurations to file `config.json`
  # please update `credential` by yourself!
  # about onthers, mare sure you know how it works before updating.

          "enable": false,
          "endpoint": ""
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

+ Pull and run docker image `shawzt/minio-pi` as a daemon service

  ```
  docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name minio_service \
  -v /mnt/minio_storage:/export \
  -v /mnt/minio_storage:/root/.minio \
  shawzt/minio-pi server /export
  ```
